## Quakecraft
> Quakecraft is a fast-paced First Person Shooter inspired by the game Quake and re-imagined for
> Minecraft by the Hypixel Network. Your Railgun permits you to kill your opponents in one shot.
> You can play against a swarm of enemies, or in a team competition. This plugin aims to freshen
> the original idea up by updating it to a more stylized version.
